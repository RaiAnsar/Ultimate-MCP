# Ultimate MCP v2.0 Test Suite Fixes Summary

## Initial State
- **Total Tests**: 119
- **Failing Tests**: 70
- **Passing Tests**: 49

## Current State
- **Total Tests**: 119
- **Failing Tests**: 59
- **Passing Tests**: 60

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Import Path Errors
- **Issue**: Transport imports had `.js` extensions that Vite couldn't resolve
- **Fix**: Removed `.js` extensions from all transport imports in tests

### 2. UUID Module Replacement
- **Issue**: `uuid` package not installed, causing import errors
- **Fix**: Replaced all `uuidv4()` calls with Node.js built-in `crypto.randomUUID()`

### 3. LazyToolRegistry Missing Methods
- **Issue**: Tests expected methods that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added `hasToolMetadata()` and proper `getImplementation()` methods

### 4. PerformanceMonitor Missing Methods
- **Issue**: Tests expected execution tracking methods
- **Fix**: Added `startToolExecution()` and `endToolExecution()` methods with proper metric tracking

### 5. Cost Optimizer Return Structure
- **Issue**: `selectOptimalModel()` returned wrong structure
- **Fix**: Changed to return object with `model`, `reason`, `score`, and `estimatedCost`

### 6. Model Names in Tests
- **Issue**: Tests used short names like 'gpt-4o' instead of full 'openai/gpt-4o'
- **Fix**: Updated all model names to use full provider/model format

### 7. Performance Monitor Property Names
- **Issue**: Test expected `avgLatency`, implementation had `averageLatency`
- **Fix**: Updated test to use `averageLatency`

### 8. Browser Automation Mock Issues
- **Issue**: `waitForSelector` mock didn't return a promise
- **Fix**: Changed to `mockResolvedValue(null)`

### 9. Lazy Loading Loader Returns
- **Issue**: Loaders returning handler functions instead of ToolDefinition objects
- **Fix**: Updated all loaders to return complete ToolDefinition objects

### 10. Model Router Reasoning
- **Issue**: Reasoning didn't include task type keywords
- **Fix**: Added task type to beginning of reasoning string

### 11. Test Timing Issues
- **Issue**: setTimeout used without waiting
- **Fix**: Changed to async/await with Promise wrapper

## Remaining Issues

### Browser Automation Tests (17 failures)
- Mock functions not being recognized (mockResolvedValueOnce, mockImplementation)
- Need to properly set up Vitest mocks for page methods

### Cost Optimizer Tests (13 failures)
- Model selection logic not finding appropriate models
- Budget constraint tests failing
- Cost tracking not accumulating properly

### Performance Monitor Tests (12 failures)
- Metrics not being properly tracked/calculated
- System metrics returning undefined values

### Model Router Tests (4 failures)
- Alternative models not being populated correctly
- Performance history integration issues

### Transport Tests (13 failures)
- WebSocket transport initialization issues
- Broadcasting and error handling tests failing

## Next Steps

1. Fix Vitest mock setup for browser automation
2. Debug cost optimizer model selection logic
3. Fix performance monitor metric calculations
4. Ensure model router provides proper alternatives
5. Fix WebSocket transport test setup

## Key Learnings

1. Always use full model names in format 'provider/model'
2. Ensure async operations are properly awaited in tests
3. Mock returns must match expected types (promises for async operations)
4. LazyToolRegistry loaders must return complete ToolDefinition objects
5. Property names must match exactly between implementation and tests
